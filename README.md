## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://i.imgur.com/7TSFIix.png)

This is an online rendition of the classic whack-a-mole game, built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. In this game, players must use their mouse to click on the moles as they pop up from their holes. The moles will appear randomly, and players must be quick to whack them before they disappear again. Each mole whacked earns the player a point, and the game ends when the time runs out.

This game is a fun and challenging way to test your reflexes and hand-eye coordination. The game logic and functionality are implemented using JavaScript specifically JavaScript DOM manipulators. Give it a try and see how many moles you can whack!
